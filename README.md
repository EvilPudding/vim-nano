# vim-nano

Mighty nano inside a vim. I wrote this for a parody hackathon.

# Requirements

- neovim (termopen abused to replicate nano interface)
- python (2 or 3, doesn't matter)

# Installation
Not yet packaged as a plugin, because you don't need a vimrc anyway.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nims11/vim-nano.git
$ cd vim-nano/
$ nvim -u nano.vim
```
